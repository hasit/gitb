## Installing

```
go get github.com/hasit/gitb
```

## Using

Once you have successfully installed `gitb`, it will put an executable binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder. If you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your shell's `$PATH`, you are good to go. If not, do it!

You can call `gitb` from any local git repository. 

```
gitb
```
